Simple JavaScript Pokemon App:
This is a Javascript app, where I use an external API (PokeAPI v2 (https://pokeapi.co/)) to get 150 pok√©mons from the list. With this link you can go directly to the site: https://marcohildebrandt.github.io/simple-js-app. 

Features: 
A list of Pokemon with their names displayed as buttons. Clicking on a button opens a modal with information about the selected Pokemon, including its height, types and front and a default image. A search bar to search for a specific Pokemon by name.
